Swift Project on AI x Sustainability/Environment

Note: The original app name was AI2ClimateChange, however I thought that was a bit of a mouthful and changed it to EcoMind AI.


As per challenge guidelines (however a little beyond them), 
I chose to do both "How AI is having a negative impact of climate change and sustainability" and "How AI can be used to create solutions for climate change and sustainability"

Now although I understand this isn't exactly aligned with challenge perspectives,
I wanted for users using this app to grab the full experience (both positive and negative) about AI and formulate their own thoughts/opinions 
on if AI truly does have potential to save our environment, or if its harms outweigh its benefits. 
I had this idea that if I showed users just one perspective, that wouldn't be possible and the analysis would be skewed.

Therefore, here's my first iteration of this app!

A couple of key features/bug(s)?:
1) HuggingFace API call -> Takes a long time to respond. Even if you put in your own API key, it takes a couple of minutes before the AI can actually load itself and respond.
2) Links affiliated with this project are not mine, I just found the free resources by myself through intense research and curated the library of sorts.
3) Most images, if not all, are affiliated with Canva, they are not my personal creations.
